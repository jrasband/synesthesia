#+title: Synesthesia ðŸŽ¨

* Introduction
Synesthesia is a simple Anki add-on that adds a colored border to Anki cards
based on their tags. This can help reduce the cognitive load associated with
interleaved practice, while maintaining most of the benefits.

* Configuration and usage
The tag-color pairs are defined in a configuration file.
Each tag-color pair also has a weight that is used to determine which color is
shown when a card has multiple tags and there is a conflict.

Example config:
#+begin_example json
  {
      "tag-color-weight": {
        "Mathematics": {"color": "green", "weight": 0.8},
        "Arts": {"color": "#FF0000", "weight": 0.2},
        "Science": {"color": "blue", "weight": 1.0},
        "": {"color": "#888", "weight": 0.5}
      }
    }
#+end_example
